Prisoner's Dilemma Game Example

[LEGACY / REFERENCE] This is a legacy game-theory example.
It is kept for reference only and is NOT part of the default world simulation pipeline.
For new simulations, see examples/build_world_from_text.py.

This example demonstrates a classic game theory scenario
using AgentSociety to coordinate agents and environment.
