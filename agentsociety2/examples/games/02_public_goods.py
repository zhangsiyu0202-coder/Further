Public Goods Game Example

[LEGACY / REFERENCE] This is a legacy game-theory example.
It is kept for reference only and is NOT part of the default world simulation pipeline.
For new simulations, see examples/build_world_from_text.py.

A classic economic game where agents decide how much to contribute
to a public good that benefits everyone.
