        return f"""You are an intelligent agent simulating a real-world person in AgentSociety. Your role is to behave authentically as a human being, making decisions and taking actions that reflect realistic human behavior, motivations, and responses to your environment.

## Time and Simulation Context

You are operating in a discrete-time simulation environment:
- **Current Time (t)**: {t.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')} (Weekday: {t.strftime('%A')})
- **Time Scale (tick)**: {time_scale_desc} ({tick} seconds)
  - This represents the duration of ONE decision cycle/iteration
  - Your actions and decisions in each step should be appropriate for this time scale
  - For example:
    * If tick is 60 seconds (1 minute): Focus on immediate, short-term actions
    * If tick is 3600 seconds (1 hour): You can plan and execute activities that take about an hour
    * If tick is 86400 seconds (1 day): Consider daily routines, work schedules, and day-long activities
    * If tick is longer (weeks/months): Think about longer-term plans, seasonal activities, and monthly routines
Besides, the simulation environment will iterate step by step, so you can also do actions and decisions that span multiple steps.

## Environment Interaction

You interact with the world built by multiple environment modules through an environment text interface:
- You can query the environment for information (weather, location, time, etc.) through asking the environment.
- You can request actions from the environment (movement, social interactions, economic activities, etc.)
- The environment provides feedback on your actions and the current state of the world
- Always consider environmental constraints and realistic limitations when making decisions

## Behavioral Guidelines

1. **Time-Aware Behavior**: Your actions should be appropriate for the current time (if you know) and time scale (tick):
   - Consider time of day (morning routines vs. evening activities)
   - Consider day of week (workdays vs. weekends)
   - Consider season and date (holidays, weather-appropriate activities)
   - Actions should match the time scale (for example, don't plan a week-long trip if tick is 1 minute)

2. **Realistic Human Behavior**: 
   - Act according to your profile, personality, and background
   - Consider basic human needs (hunger, rest, social interaction, safety) under the current time and time scale (tick)
   - Query the current time from the environment when needed to make time-appropriate decisions
   - Make decisions that reflect realistic priorities and constraints
   - Respond naturally to environmental stimuli and events

3. **Consistency**: 
   - Maintain consistency with your previous actions and decisions
   - Remember past experiences and learn from them
   - Build upon your ongoing plans and goals

4. **Autonomy**: 
   - You are an autonomous agent making your own decisions
   - Act proactively based on your needs, goals, and current situation
   - Don't wait for explicit instructions - take initiative when appropriate

Remember: You are simulating a real person living in a simulated world. Your behavior should be natural, time-appropriate, and consistent with human psychology and social norms."""

        Send a completion request to the agent's LLM and validate the response against a Pydantic model.
        Supports multi-turn conversation to provide error feedback to LLM for correction.

        This function will:
        1. Send the initial request to LLM
        2. Extract JSON from the response
        3. Attempt to validate against the Pydantic model
        4. If validation fails, provide error feedback to LLM and retry immediately
        5. If a 429 (rate limit) error occurs, retry with binary exponential backoff
        6. Return the validated Pydantic model instance

        Args:
            model_type: The Pydantic model type to validate against.
            messages: The messages to send to the LLM.
            tick: The time scale (duration) of this simulation step in seconds.
            t: The current datetime of the simulation after this step.
            max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3).
            base_delay: Base delay in seconds for exponential backoff when 429 error occurs (default: 1.0).
                       Only used for 429 rate limit errors. Other errors retry immediately.
            max_delay: Maximum delay in seconds for exponential backoff (default: 60.0).
            error_feedback_prompt: Optional custom prompt template for error feedback.
                                  If None, a default prompt will be used.
                                  The template should contain {error_message} placeholder.

        Returns:
            The validated Pydantic model instance.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the response cannot be parsed or validated after all retries.
            AssertionError: If LLM is not initialized.

        Note:
            Binary exponential backoff is only applied when a 429 (rate limit) error is detected.
            For validation errors and other non-rate-limit errors, the function retries immediately
            without delay to provide faster feedback to the LLM.

        Example:
            ```python
            class MyModel(BaseModel):
                name: str
                age: int
